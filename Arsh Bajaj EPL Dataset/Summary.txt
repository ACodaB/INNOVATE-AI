English Premier League Data Analysis – Project Summary

This project uses Python to analyze and model EPL match data.

Dataset:
- 11,113 matches, 23 features (goals, shots, fouls, cards, corners, referees, etc.)
- Target variable: match result (FTR) or goals scored

Process:
- Data cleaning, feature engineering, and encoding
- Exploratory data analysis: home advantage, fouls, corners, seasonality
- Regression modeling for goal prediction

Models:
1. Linear Regression – R² ≈ 0.209, MAE ≈ 0.64, RMSE ≈ 0.76  
2. Decision Tree – R² ≈ -0.51 (overfit), MAE ≈ 0.75  
3. XGBoost – R² ≈ 0.15, MAE ≈ 0.65

Key Insights:
- Home teams score more; shots on target predict outcomes
- Fouls/cards correlate with negative results
- Regression gives moderate accuracy; classification could do better

Future Work:
- Shift from regression to classification (win/draw/loss predictions)
- Add player stats, team form, betting odds
- Apply ensemble methods and hyperparameter tuning
